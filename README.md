# Learning C

This is a repository of various C-related exercices for me to accomplish in order to expand on and apply skills and concepts learned from Brian Kernighan's and Dennis Ritchie's **The C Programming Language, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition**. Below you can find a table of the chapters hyperlinked to their location in this repository. Each chapter contains solutions to exercises provided within the corresponding chapters. Alongside the hyperlinked chapter, you will find the concepts covered within the chapter and exercises.
